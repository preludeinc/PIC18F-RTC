## Real-Time Clock using a Microcontroller

This project is a real-time clock, where the the time can be updated using the external keypad. An external circuit with Matrix 4x4 keypad, a Hitachi LCD, and eight-bit microcontroller - PIC18F4685 on an external breadboard was wired together as part of this project.
